# Redux Saga Shopping Cart Back-end Server

## About
This server is meant to mock the functionality of a real shopping application's back-end services. It comes ready-made and complete, but with no front-end application to consume its APIs. That task is left to you.


### Usage
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run server. `npm start`
3. Navigate to the instructions page: `http://localhost:8081` (You must not already have a different application running on this port)
